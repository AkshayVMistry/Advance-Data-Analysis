<br>
Before starting with our auction process, we would first like to mention the rules and assumptions defined by us for creating the dream team. </center>


## Assumptions Taken

- The number of matches played for a player in IPL as given in the data set are less compared to what they have actually played in IPL when checked on internet, So we choose our Super 11 based on the dataset given.

- We have excluded the retired IPL players based on current news.


## Rules for Team Formation

- A team is supposed to have 12 players available - 11 on the field, of which at least seven must be Indian, and one substitute - for selection on a matchday.

- Only 4 players in a team can be foreigners. 


## Auction Process

- In this Auction process, we are selecting an super team for IPL based on a datasets from 2008-2020 containing all ball-by-ball and match-by-match order. 

- We have selected players who have played or bowled more than 300 balls only.

- Our team combination will be consisting of strong openers, middle-order hitters, all-rounders, a wicketkeeper, and quick and spin bowlers.

- For this, each player’s past IPL performance will be analysed including number of balls played/bowled, runs scored/given, strike rate/economy, 4’s and 6’s , stumps/catches, etc and finally we will be selecting our Super 11.
